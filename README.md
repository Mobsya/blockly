# Blockly for Thymio

This is a fork of Google's Blockly that adds blocks to control the Thymio robot. It also provides an AESL code generator that converts visual programs using these blocks to the Aseba language.

Google's Blockly is a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can drag
blocks together to build programs.  All code is free and open source.
